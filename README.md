# Databeat Assessment
NOTE: All the work produced here is solely my effort using the help of online resources. I am confidently equipped to demonstrate the code and knowledge produced here. :)
#### Please find all the tasks as separate .py files in the respective folders

### Task-1 & Task-2
Please run the respective tests_task_1.py and tests_task_2.py files to see the test cases. 

(If required, kindly check the requirements.txt file for task-2).  

### Task-3
Please run the file and input the arguments to test the code.

### Task-4
Please run the main.py function. 

(Kindly note that the code for Task-4 is divided into several files and the log file for task-4 is in the IPYNB folder).
