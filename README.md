# Databeat Assessment
NOTE: All the work produced here is solely my effort using the help of online resources. I am confidently equipped to demonstrate the code and knowledge produced here. :)
### Please find all the tasks as separate .py files.

For task_1.py and task_2.py, please run the respective tests_task_1.py and tests_task_2.py files to see the test cases.

For task_3, please run the file and input the arguments to test the code.

For task_4, please run the main.py function. (Note that the code for Task-4 is divided into several files).

### If .ipynb files are required, please navigate to the IPYNB folder to view the files

The log file for task-4 is in the IPYNB folder.

## Thanks DATABEAT for this exciting assessment :)
